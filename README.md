# ðŸ§  Python Practice Challenges by Sean Mayers

Welcome to my Python practice repository â€” a growing collection of coding challenges I'm working on to sharpen my skills in preparation for high-impact roles in software engineering and system modeling (MBSE).

## ðŸ”¹ Challenge 1: Palindrome Checker

This file includes two implementations of a function to check whether a word is a palindrome.

### âœ… `is_palindrome_loop(word)`

- Uses a manual loop to compare characters from both ends.  
- Good for interviews when you want to show logic step-by-step.

### âœ… `is_palindrome_sliced(word)`

- Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in slicing: `word[::-1]`  
- Clean and concise â€” a Pythonic one-liner.

### ðŸ§ª Test Cases Include:

- `"racecar"` â†’ `True`  
- `"hello"` â†’ `False`  
- `"madam"` â†’ `True`  
- `""` â†’ `True`  
- `"a"` â†’ `True`

## ðŸš€ Why This Repo Exists

Iâ€™m transitioning into high-paying software and MBSE roles by:

- Practicing data structures, algorithms, and whiteboard-style problems  
- Documenting my solutions clearly  
- Building a strong portfolio that reflects my engineering background

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Coming Soon

- New challenges (sorting, recursion, algorithms)  
- Flask-based project extensions  
- SysML + MBSE projects modeled in Cameo
