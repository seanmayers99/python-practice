# MBSE Day 2: Internal Block Diagram – Safety Monitoring System

This internal block diagram (IBD) represents the internal structure and interactions of the components in the Safety Monitoring System I modeled. It is based on the BDD created in Day 1, and focuses on the flow of data and interactions between internal parts of the system.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This diagram helps me visualize how different parts of the Safety Monitoring System work together at runtime, particularly how they exchange data. It builds on the block definition structure and lets me map actual usage and interfaces.

---

## 🧠 What This Diagram Shows

- **Block interactions** between the Safety Analyzer, Incident Reporter, and Communication Interface
- **Ports and data flows** (like `incidentOut`, `transmitData`, `reportStatus`)
- **Directed connections** showing how information is passed between components

## 💼 Why This Matters

This diagram is part of my MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering) practice portfolio. It shows how I apply system-level thinking to software-relevant domains by understanding internal communication patterns and structuring components accordingly.

I created this as part of my prep for future roles that intersect system modeling, safety engineering, and software integration — especially in aerospace, defense, and intelligent systems.
