# MBSE Day 3: Activity Diagram â€“ Agile Feature Breakdown Tool

This activity diagram models the behavior flow of the Agile Feature Breakdown Tool I developed to simulate a real-world software system planning task. It shows how a user interacts with the tool and how data flows from input to export.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this diagram is to demonstrate how behavioral logic maps to system roles. This helps illustrate how software engineers and system engineers can define clear responsibilities between users and tools in an Agile planning environment.

---

## ðŸ§  What This Diagram Shows

- **Actor swimlanes** (User and Tool) for role clarity
- **Control flow** from user input to backend processing
- **Structured behavior** that supports feature decomposition
- **Export action** tied to JSON backlog output

## ðŸ§© Diagram: `agile_tool_activity_diagram.png`

This diagram was built in draw.io and color-coded by actor:
- ðŸŸ¦ User Actions (Input, View Results)
- ðŸŸ© Tool Actions (Receive, Generate, Export)

## ðŸ’¼ Why This Matters

This diagram is part of my MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering) practice portfolio. It reflects my experience in:

- Building tools that support Agile and software planning workflows
- Understanding how to structure logic behaviorally and visually
- Bridging system-level thinking with backend development

As a system and software safety engineer transitioning into more software-focused engineering roles, Iâ€™m building diagrams like this to better communicate how my tools function at a system level â€” a valuable skill for roles in aerospace, defense, and intelligent systems.
